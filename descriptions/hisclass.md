HISCLASS is a class scheme based on HISCO. It was developed by Marco van Leeuwen and Ineke Maas using the American Dictionay of Occupational Titles (DOT) and expert knowledge to place the HISCO codes in a class system of 12 classes. These classes were defined on the basis of four dimensions of class structure: a) manual or non-manual type of occupation, b) skill level of the occupation, c) supervisional character of the occupation d) economic sector (primary/ secondary/ tertiary sector). In the selection of these dimensions they were inspired by the work of GÃ©rard Bouchard, Erik Olin Wright and John Goldthorpe.
