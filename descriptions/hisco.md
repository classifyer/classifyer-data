Occupation is one of the few variables which provides insights in an individual’s relation to society in a distinct way. However, doing comparative studies over time using occupational titles is very problematic due to changing titles and meaning. A well-known classification and undertaking dealing with the classification of historical occupations is the Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations (HISCO). This system has been created by a consortium of researchers and is currently one of the standards when dealing with historical occupational titles. Formulated in 2002, the model complements the ILO's ISCO68 scheme, as it prescribes a universal code system for examining occupation descriptions.
