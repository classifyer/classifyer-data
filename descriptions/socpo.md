SOCPO stands for SOCial POwer and is another version of a stratification in social groups originating from the HISCO scheme. It was developed by Bart Van de Putte and Andrew Miles and the distinction in social groups is based on the principle of social power, defined as “the potential to influence one’s destiny—or ‘life chances’—through control of (scarce) resources.”
