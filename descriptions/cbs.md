Since 1966, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) has assigned unique code numbers to municipalities in the Netherlands. When the code numbers were introduced, the municipalities with a certain code series were located in one province, so that numbering was continued (no numbers were skipped) and each province was numbered alphabetically. Nowadays, regardless of the provincial location, the numbers are randomly assigned to newly formed administrative entities, starting with the number 1500. The CBS systems does not provide codes for municipalities before 1830. Moreover, in contrast to AMCO, the CBS codes change when the municipality changes its name.
